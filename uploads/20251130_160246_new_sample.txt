01/01/24, 09:32 - Pranjali: Good morninggg 🌞 Headache level: 7/10 but heart is full 😂
01/01/24, 09:35 - Lalit: Good morning love 😘 Same here, brain is complaining but last night was worth it
01/01/24, 09:37 - Pranjali: 100% worth it. Your dramatic new-year speech was my fav part btw 😌😂
01/01/24, 09:40 - Lalit: EXCUSE ME that was a very serious TED talk about us and extra socks 😤
01/01/24, 09:42 - Pranjali: Haha yes, "Invest in quality socks and quality love" — 10/10 quote of the year 🧦❤️
01/01/24, 09:45 - Lalit: Put it on a T-shirt, I dare you
01/01/24, 09:47 - Pranjali: Don't tempt me, you know I will 😏

01/01/24, 11:10 - Lalit: What’s the plan today? Family lunch? Sleep? Existential crisis?
01/01/24, 11:13 - Pranjali: 😂 All three. Lunch at home, then nap, then overthinking my whole life at 7 PM
01/01/24, 11:15 - Lalit: Book me a slot in between nap and crisis. I’ll call 🧾
01/01/24, 11:17 - Pranjali: Done. 6:30 PM: "Talk to boyfriend who thinks he’s a therapist"
01/01/24, 11:18 - Lalit: Wow. Rude and accurate.

01/01/24, 14:05 - Pranjali: Just had lunch. Mom made like 6 dishes for "New Year energy" 😂 I’m so full
01/01/24, 14:07 - Lalit: Lucky. I just had leftover pizza and guilt
01/01/24, 14:10 - Pranjali: You love that pizza and you know it
01/01/24, 14:12 - Lalit: True. But I’d trade it for your mom’s paneer any day
01/01/24, 14:15 - Pranjali: She likes you so much, if you came home she’d make you your own tray
01/01/24, 14:17 - Lalit: Don’t test me, I’ll show up with flowers and an empty stomach

01/01/24, 16:20 - Pranjali: Going for that nap now. If I don’t wake up in 2 hours, send rescue
01/01/24, 16:22 - Lalit: I’ll text you. If no reply, I’ll assume you became one with the bed 🛏️
01/01/24, 16:23 - Pranjali: Most likely yes 😂

01/01/24, 18:45 - Lalit: Hellooo, therapist appointment time ⏰
01/01/24, 18:50 - Pranjali: Lol I literally woke up 5 mins ago. Hair is a mess, brain is rebooting
01/01/24, 18:52 - Lalit: That’s when you’re cutest tbh
01/01/24, 18:54 - Pranjali: Stoppp, I look like a potato
01/01/24, 18:55 - Lalit: My fav potato 🥔❤️
01/01/24, 18:57 - Pranjali: Ugh fine, that was cute

01/01/24, 19:10 - Pranjali: Okay so, small overthinking session happened 🙃
01/01/24, 19:12 - Lalit: I’m listening 👂
01/01/24, 19:15 - Pranjali: New year = new goals and suddenly I feel like I’m not doing enough. Work, health, savings, everything
01/01/24, 19:18 - Lalit: First of all, you’re doing great. Second, we don’t need to fix everything in one month
01/01/24, 19:20 - Lalit: We can make a realistic list together. No crazy 5 AM gym + 3 side hustles nonsense
01/01/24, 19:23 - Pranjali: Thank you. I really needed someone to say that 🥺
01/01/24, 19:25 - Lalit: Anytime. We’ll have one realistic plan, one slightly over-ambitious plan, and one “if we become millionaires” plan 😂
01/01/24, 19:27 - Pranjali: I call dibs on the millionaire plan. I’m buying a house with a giant library
01/01/24, 19:30 - Lalit: And I’m getting a gaming corner and a giant couch for us. Priorities.

01/01/24, 21:05 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 21:06 - Pranjali: Look at my notebook, I already wrote "2024 Goals (No Pressure)" on top 😌
01/01/24, 21:08 - Lalit: I love that. That’s your vibe: ambitious but not toxic 😂
01/01/24, 21:10 - Pranjali: Ambitious but needs snacks every 2 hours*
01/01/24, 21:12 - Lalit: I support this version fully

01/01/24, 23:00 - Lalit: Heading to bed. Today was soft and nice, even from a distance
01/01/24, 23:03 - Pranjali: It was. Thank you for listening to my overthinking and not judging
01/01/24, 23:05 - Lalit: Never. I signed up for the full package, remember?
01/01/24, 23:07 - Pranjali: Lucky you 😌 Good night love
01/01/24, 23:09 - Lalit: Good night, my favourite human 💫

02/01/24, 07:55 - Pranjali: Good morning! Back to normal life 😭
02/01/24, 07:57 - Lalit: Good morning. Yup, holidays officially over. Inbox demons waiting already
02/01/24, 08:00 - Pranjali: Stay strong soldier 💻
02/01/24, 08:02 - Lalit: Motivation received. What time do you log in?
02/01/24, 08:05 - Pranjali: 9:30. Trying to squeeze in a quick stretch and coffee before that
02/01/24, 08:07 - Lalit: Proud of you. I’m just squeezing in “staring at the wall” time

02/01/24, 09:20 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 09:21 - Pranjali: Work from home setup back in action
02/01/24, 09:23 - Lalit: Love this. Laptop, coffee, and your little plant in the corner 🌿
02/01/24, 09:25 - Pranjali: That plant is thriving purely on my gossip and complaining
02/01/24, 09:27 - Lalit: Explains why it looks so healthy 😂

02/01/24, 11:45 - Lalit: How’s your morning going?
02/01/24, 11:48 - Pranjali: Busy but okay. Had a tiny panic when my screen froze mid-meeting 🙃
02/01/24, 11:50 - Lalit: Oh no 😂 What did you do?
02/01/24, 11:52 - Pranjali: Turned camera off, restarted, came back with "sorry guys, little tech glitch" and pretended my soul wasn’t leaving my body
02/01/24, 11:55 - Lalit: Pro-level recovery. I’m impressed

02/01/24, 13:05 - Pranjali: Lunch?
02/01/24, 13:07 - Lalit: Just ordered something unhealthy, don’t judge
02/01/24, 13:09 - Pranjali: I’m literally eating instant noodles, zero rights to judge 🍜
02/01/24, 13:12 - Lalit: We are doing our best 😂

02/01/24, 15:10 - Pranjali: Ugh. My manager just dropped a "quick chat?" message. The fear is real.
02/01/24, 15:12 - Lalit: Oh god, the worst three words in the English language. Keep me updated.
02/01/24, 15:20 - Pranjali: False alarm! He just wanted to share a "motivational" article about productivity. Kill me.
02/01/24, 15:22 - Lalit: LOL. The classic. Should I send him my TED talk on socks?
02/01/24, 15:25 - Pranjali: PLS DO. He'd probably promote you.

02/01/24, 16:25 - Pranjali: My brain is done for today
02/01/24, 16:27 - Lalit: Same. Mini video call in the evening? No fancy talk, just us being tired together
02/01/24, 16:30 - Pranjali: That actually sounds perfect 🥺 Say 8 PM?
02/01/24, 16:32 - Lalit: 8 PM it is. I’ll show up with messy hair and low battery energy

02/01/24, 17:45 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 17:46 - Pranjali: This reel of a dog trying to eat a snowflake 😭😂
02/01/24, 17:48 - Lalit: OMG 😂😂😂 Sent it to my mom, that's her spirit animal

02/01/24, 20:02 - Lalit: Ready?
02/01/24, 20:04 - Pranjali: Yes, calling you 🌐

02/01/24, 21:15 - Pranjali: That call was exactly what I needed. No deep topics, just us laughing at random reels 🤝
02/01/24, 21:18 - Lalit: Honestly, that’s peak relationship quality for me 😂
02/01/24, 21:20 - Pranjali: Same. Life is stressful enough, I like that we can just exist together
02/01/24, 21:23 - Lalit: We’re a good team. Even on low-battery days
02/01/24, 21:25 - Pranjali: The best team ❤️

02/01/24, 22:40 - Lalit: I should sleep, early meeting tomorrow 😩
02/01/24, 22:42 - Pranjali: Go sleep then, don’t scroll reels till 1 AM again 👀
02/01/24, 22:44 - Lalit: Exposed.
02/01/24, 22:45 - Pranjali: I know you too well mister
02/01/24, 22:47 - Lalit: Okay okay, I’ll actually sleep. Good night love
02/01/24, 22:49 - Pranjali: Good night. Proud of us for surviving the first working day of the year 😂
02/01/24, 22:50 - Lalit: Same. One day down, many cozy days with you to go ❤️
03/01/24, 08:15 - Lalit: Morning. The struggle to get out of bed is real today.
03/01/24, 08:20 - Pranjali: For real. I hit snooze 4 times. My willpower is non-existent.
03/01/24, 08:22 - Lalit: We need a support group. "People Who Were Fine 2 Days Ago But Are Now Tired"
03/01/24, 08:25 - Pranjali: I'd join. First meeting topic: why is coffee not working fast enough?

03/01/24, 10:30 - Pranjali: You will not believe the drama in my work group. Two teams are fighting over project credit. It's like a bad TV show.
03/01/24, 10:33 - Lalit: Ooooh, pop the popcorn. Who's winning?
03/01/24, 10:35 - Pranjali: Right now, it's a stalemate. I'm just here taking notes for my future novel 😂
03/01/24, 10:37 - Lalit: My hero. My work drama is just... Excel sheets that won't add up. Much less exciting.

03/01/24, 12:50 - Lalit: Lunch? I brought something from home. Trying to be an adult.
03/01/24, 12:53 - Pranjali: Look at you! I'm having dal-rice. The ultimate comfort food.
03/01/24, 12:55 - Lalit: Can't go wrong with that. My adulting attempt is a questionable pasta.

03/01/24, 15:45 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 15:46 - Pranjali: Look what I found while cleaning my drawer! Our movie tickets from that awful comedy we saw last month 😂
03/01/24, 15:48 - Lalit: OMG we promised to never speak of that film again! The cringe was real.
03/01/24, 15:50 - Pranjali: But the memory of us laughing AT the movie is a core one ❤️

03/01/24, 18:00 - Lalit: I'm beat. How's your evening looking?
03/01/24, 18:03 - Pranjali: Need to water my plants and then do absolutely nothing. You?
03/01/24, 18:05 - Lalit: Same. Might just lie on the floor and contemplate the ceiling.
03/01/24, 18:07 - Pranjali: A solid plan. Call you later for floor-contemplation debrief?

03/01/24, 21:30 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 21:31 - Pranjali: My plant family is hydrated and thriving. I am a proud plant mom.
03/01/24, 21:33 - Lalit: They look amazing! Meanwhile, my cactus is judging me for my life choices.
03/01/24, 21:35 - Pranjali: Cacti are judgy by nature. Don't take it personally.

03/01/24, 23:10 - Pranjali: Okay, going to bed before I fall asleep on the couch. Good night!
03/01/24, 23:12 - Lalit: Night love. Sweet dreams of hydrated plants and non-cringey movies 😘

04/01/24, 08:45 - Pranjali: THURSDAY. We can make it. Almost there.
04/01/24, 08:47 - Lalit: We can! It's Friday's eve! 🎉
04/01/24, 08:50 - Pranjali: That's the spirit! My motivation is 100% powered by the weekend.

04/01/24, 11:00 - Lalit: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:01 - Lalit: Look what my mom sent me. A 10-step tutorial on how to make perfect chai. She thinks I'm surviving on coffee and despair.
04/01/24, 11:03 - Pranjali: She's not entirely wrong 😂 That's so sweet though.
04/01/24, 11:05 - Lalit: I know. I feel guilty. Might attempt it this weekend and send her a photo as proof of life.

04/01/24, 13:20 - Pranjali: Ugh. Just had a super annoying call with a client. They keep changing the requirements.
04/01/24, 13:22 - Lalit: The worst. Do you need to vent or would a distraction be better?
04/01/24, 13:25 - Pranjali: Distraction, please. Send me a funny meme. Anything.
04/01/24, 13:27 - Lalit: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 13:28 - Pranjali: OKAY that made me snort-laugh. Thank you 😂

04/01/24, 16:00 - Pranjali: I'm officially declaring my brain a no-work zone for the rest of the day.
04/01/24, 16:02 - Lalit: Smart. Any plans for tonight?
04/01/24, 16:05 - Pranjali: Laundry. The eternal, exciting struggle.
04/01/24, 16:07 - Lalit: Living the dream. I have to go to the bank. Adult life is so glamorous.

04/01/24, 19:45 - Lalit: Bank mission accomplished. I feel 100 years older.
04/01/24, 19:48 - Pranjali: I feel you. Laundry is folded and put away. We are responsible legends.
04/01/24, 19:50 - Lalit: Legends who are now exhausted from basic tasks. Video call?
04/01/24, 19:52 - Pranjali: Yes, but I warn you, I have zero energy to form coherent sentences.
04/01/24, 19:55 - Lalit: Perfect. We can just sit in comfortable silence.

04/01/24, 22:40 - Pranjali: Okay, heading to bed. Today was a proper adulting day.
04/01/24, 22:42 - Lalit: We survived. Good night, my responsible legend ❤️
04/01/24, 22:45 - Pranjali: Good night 😴

05/01/24, 09:05 - Pranjali: FRIDAY! WE MADE IT! 🥳☕
05/01/24, 09:07 - Lalit: YES! The weekend is upon us! Any big plans?
05/01/24, 09:10 - Pranjali: Big plan: Grocery shopping. And maybe ordering in and watching a movie. You?
05/01/24, 09:12 - Lalit: That sounds perfect. Can I invite myself to your movie night plan? I'll bring snacks.
05/01/24, 09:15 - Pranjali: Obviously! Your presence is mandatory. But only if the snacks are good.
05/01/24, 09:17 - Lalit: I accept these terms.

05/01/24, 12:15 - Pranjali: My colleague just brought homemade cupcakes. Friday salvation!
05/01/24, 12:17 - Lalit: Lucky! I'm jealous. My lunch is sad in comparison.
05/01/24, 12:19 - Pranjali: I'd save you one but it would be a crumb by the time I saw you 😂

05/01/24, 14:50 - Lalit: This last workday stretch is always the longest. Time has stopped.
05/01/24, 14:53 - Pranjali: It's a scientific fact. The last two hours of a Friday are equal to an entire working week.
05/01/24, 14:55 - Lalit: So true. Just staring at the clock.

05/01/24, 17:30 - Pranjali: I'M FREE! 🕊️ Logging off now!
05/01/24, 17:32 - Lalit: Me too! Weekend mode: activated. What time should I come over tomorrow?
05/01/24, 17:35 - Pranjali: Come around 5? We can figure out dinner then.
05/01/24, 17:37 - Lalit: Perfect. Can't wait to see you 😘
05/01/24, 17:39 - Pranjali: Me too ❤️ Have a good night!

05/01/24, 21:10 - Pranjali: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 21:11 - Pranjali: My view right now. PJs, blanket, and no thoughts.
05/01/24, 21:13 - Lalit: The dream. I'm already in the same state. We're living the high life.
05/01/24, 21:15 - Pranjali: Absolutely. Talk tomorrow? Sweet dreams!
05/01/24, 21:17 - Lalit: Sweet dreams, love. ❤️
